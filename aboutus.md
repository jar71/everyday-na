### Our story

To start I would like to say we are just a simple young couple with big dreams. We were big already when we met each other but together we have grown bigger.
Anthony is a 23 years old Italian/American, seeking the dream of finishing system enginering school, with many projects using technology to improve the everyday life.
Nicole is a 21 years old Dominican, with a degree as a teacher for English as a second language, passionated about everything related to art. 

We both had a very hard time in our past life with ejoying food and staying healthy so when food became a subject we started looking for a way to enjoy our favorites meals without being scared of those extra pounds. Anthony was into his Keto Life, but didnt sound exciting for Nicole, so they decided to go for a low carb/calorie counting life by the side of the app [MyFitnessPal](https://myfitnesspal.com), they started recreating their normal life food and any other take out exciting food, turning many recipes into their own and sometimes creating their own different variations.

After some months of this they considered their new lifestyle worthy of being shared, so they opened a instagram page, but there was no way of staying only there, more had to come, it was time for a blog,and so our website came to life. 

Please, feel free of recreating and judging by yourself, do not forget of tagging us!
