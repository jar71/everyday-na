#### The thickest cookies, with the perfect amount of sugar, and they are easy and fast to make? Is this even possible? Yes it is. I am going to show you how, right now. 

This is not just another cookie recipe, this is the healthier, thickest, and coolest chewiest cookie I could ever made, after a few try and fail I came out with what for *us* is the perfect cookie,there was a time in December that I went crazy making this cookies everytime I could, I mean what is better for a sweet fast treat than a cup of milk and two cookies.. or four, because once you have one you can not stop, with this recipe you can make a batch of around ten-twelve cookies. Ok I won't keep you any longer, here you have it!

Ingredients:

- Cabbage *(5 oz)*
- Carrots *(4 oz)*
- Chicken bouillon powder *(2 tsp.)*
- Fresh ginger *(.5 oz)*
- Garlic *(1 clove or 2 depending size)*
- Soy sauce *(2 tbsp.)*
- Miso paste or sauce *(4 tbsp.)*
- Sesame oil *(2 tsp.)*
- Eggs *(as many as you want, at least one per plate)*
- Green onions *(spring onions, 1oz)*
- Beef, I used Beef skirt steak *(4oz)*
- Sesame seeds

Procedure:
With your clean cabbage and carrots, you will start chopping into strips, can also use a shredder by the big side. Then will cut the beef steak (can season or not ) Mince one garlic clove and 1 teaspoon ginger. Chopped your spring onion and set aside.
Once this is done, will spray oil in a pan a low heat, can use canola oil or any you have at hand, I used avocado oil spray, throw your garlic and ginger and continue with beef, let cook for a little until is almost cooked well, then throw in carrots and cabbage and let soften.

Set aside in another pan boiling water for as many eggs as you will like, cook until your preference.

Once has softened enough, put 4 cups of warm water, and will start seasoning with 2 teaspoons of chicken bouillon, 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 4 tablespoons miso paste or sauce, stir, let boil once and then let sit at low heat.

Meanwhile put Ramen noodles into boiling water, let boil until al dente, drain and bring into deep bowl.
Also bring our Miso soup into a different bowl. Arrange your noodles, Miso, eggs, spring onion and sesame seeds at the table, ready to serve.
