# Chocolate Chip Cookies

> This is not just another cookie recipe, this is the healthier, thickest, and coolest chewiest cookie I could ever made, after a few try and fail I came out with what for *us* is the perfect cookie,there was a time in December that I went crazy making this cookies every time I could, I mean what is better for a sweet fast treat than a cup of milk and two cookies.. or four, because once you have one you can not stop, with this recipe you can make a batch of around ten-twelve cookies. Okay I won't keep you any longer, here you have it!

## Ingredients

- Butter | 1 cup / 7 Oz. | Softened
- Light Brown Sugar | 6 Oz. 
- Eggs | 2 eggs | 100 g.
- Baking Powder | 1/2 tsp.
- Baking Soda | 1 tsp.
- Sea Salt | 1 tsp.
- Chocolate Chips | 4 Oz.
- Pure Vanilla Extract | 2 tsp.
- Whole Wheat Flour | 3 Cups | 12Oz.

Mix the other wet ingredients into the butter and sugar mixture.

## Instructions

Mix together dry ingredients with wet ingredients slowly.

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. 
2. Get your baking pan ready with parchment paper and set aside.
3. In a bowl start mixing all you dry ingredients as flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt. **DON'T PUT SUGAR IN HERE.**
4. Soften the butter in the microwave for a few seconds.
5. Now in another bowl cream together butter and sugar until fully combined.
6. Beat eggs and vanilla until fluff.
7. Start mixing together your ingredients, I recommend you start pouring your dry ingredients with sugar and butter and next your eggs. 
8. Once fully combined add your chocolate chips and mix well again.
9. Next step will depend on you, you can use and ice cream spoon, a normal spoon or just use your hand to make little or big balls, it will depend on how big your cookies, just make sure to place them a least to 2 centimeters apart in your prepared baking pan.
10. Everything that is left is to put them in your preheated oven for 8-10 mins. Take them out just when they are starting to turn brown.

Leave to cool for a few minutes before enjoying.
