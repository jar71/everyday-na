# Buttermilk Chocolate Cake

> I'm a chocolate addict, trust me, I am, and I adore juicy, moist food, so I created this cake, I live for this, I am the one who always orders chocolate cake, but I do not always end satisfied. Some friends being waiting years for this recipe, they know who they are, don't worry you will thank me I didn't give this recipe by then, because I just better it. This idea just hit me so bad on February 14th that I had to remake it in order to get the right ingredients and good pictures, I was just experimenting, you do not know how to make something until you have make it twice. So here it is guys, completely for you.

> *1* Light brown sugar can be replaced with white sugar, using same amount.

2. Get your baking pan ready with butter and flour.
3. In a bowl start mixing all you dry ingredients as flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt.
