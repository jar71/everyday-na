This is [@nicolmart](https://github.com/nicolmart) & [@anthr76](https://github.com/anthr76) static [hugo blog](https://everydayna.art/) built with beautifulhugo. This website originally used Jekyll though we opted to swap to hugo.

We plan on serving blog entries and recipes entries though at the moment rich recipe content is not supported on beautifulhugo. We have a issue filed upstream to see if support can be added.

Right now we don't have a development branch though strides are being made to create a CI/CD pipeline with in [infra](https://github.com/anthr76/infra).
