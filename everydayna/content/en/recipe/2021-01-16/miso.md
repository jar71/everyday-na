- Green onions *(spring onions, 1oz)*
- Beef, I used Beef skirt steak *(4oz)*

Procedure:
With your clean cabbage and carrots, you will start chopping into strips, can also use a shredder by the big side. Then will cut the beef steak (can season or not ) Mince one garlic clove and 1 teaspoon ginger. Chopped your spring onion and set aside.
Once this is done, will spray oil in a pan a low heat, can use canola oil or any you have at hand, I used avocado oil spray, throw your garlic and ginger and continue with beef, let cook for a little until is almost cooked well, then throw in carrots and cabbage and let soften.

Set aside in another pan boiling water for as many eggs as you will like, cook until your preference.

Once has softened enough, put 4 cups of warm water, and will start seasoning with 2 teaspoons of chicken bouillon, 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 4 tablespoons miso paste or sauce, stir, let boil once and then let sit at low heat.

Meanwhile put Ramen noodles into boiling water, let boil until al dente, drain and bring into deep bowl.
Also bring our Miso soup into a different bowl. Arrange your noodles, Miso, eggs, spring onion and sesame seeds at the table, ready to serve.
